Scope of Work Feature Details
This application is a designed to be an online vision board for individuals.
It will feature three user views. A log-in or sign-up view for
accessing the application. An edit page, where users have full access to
update and change the content of their vision board. Finally, a vision
board view which will host the application's main features. The vision board
features (detailed below) will allow users to enter their dreams/thoughts/goals
for any period of time that is relevant and will display them back in an
engaging way for inspiration during their pursuits of happiness, career,
or whatever it is that they are working on at that moment. The features of
this page will be contained in “tiles” to differentiate one section from
the next. Information entered will be saved into a database with a timestamp
for the month and year associated with a particular entry. A stretch goal for
this project will include a fourth view where users can access the state of
their vision board for a specific month and year.
